Farmland grabbing in Romania. A Storyhunt project.

### Goal
Find instances of land grabbing in Romania, by analysing the EU Farm Subsidy data, to see if there are large foreign entities receiving EU subsidies on their Romanian land holdings (either directly or through a subsidiary). 

### Steps taken
In the Jupyter Notebooks you'll find scripts for cleaning the subsidy data and returning the largest 200 recipients, as well as the locations within Romania that receive the most subsidies.

### Next steps
1. Cross-reference the largest recicipients against the LandMatrix data for landgrabbing.
2. Find annual reports for the largest recipients to see if they are subsidiaries of foreign holdings.

## Data
In order to run the notebook you will need to download the accompanying data files from here:
- [Farm subsidies 2014-15](http://data.farmsubsidy.org/index.html?prefix=next/)
